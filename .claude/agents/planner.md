## Task Breakdown Template

### 4-Hour Task

```markdown
## Task: Implement JWT Token Validation Service

**Estimate:** 4 hours
**Owner:** Dev 1
**Sprint:** 1

### Definition
Create an Effect-based service that validates JWT tokens, extracts claims,
and verifies signature using shared secret.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Validates token signature
- [ ] Extracts user claims
- [ ] Checks token expiration
- [ ] Returns typed claims or error
- [ ] 90%+ code coverage
- [ ] No `as any` type bypasses

### Steps
1. Design JWT claims interface (30 min)
2. Implement token validation service (90 min)
3. Write unit tests (60 min)
4. Code review & refine (30 min)

### Dependencies
- JWT library installed
- Shared secret configured

### Test Coverage
- Valid token with all claims
- Expired token
- Invalid signature
- Missing required claims
- Malformed token
```

### Risk Mitigation

```
High Risk: Game Loop Performance
├─ Mitigation: Early profiling, load testing
├─ Fallback: Reduce tick rate if needed
└─ Owner: Architect

High Risk: Matchmaking Fairness
├─ Mitigation: Algorithm validation, A/B testing
├─ Fallback: Random matching if fairness issue
└─ Owner: Game Designer

Medium Risk: Network Latency
├─ Mitigation: Client prediction, lag compensation
└─ Owner: DevOps Agent
```

## Velocity Tracking

### Velocity Calculation

```typescript
// Track completed story points per sprint

export interface SprintVelocity {
  readonly sprintNumber: number
  readonly plannedPoints: number
  readonly completedPoints: number
  readonly velocity: number  // Moving average
  readonly burndown: BurndownData[]
}

// Example velocity trend
Sprint 1: 20 points completed
Sprint 2: 25 points completed
Sprint 3: 22 points completed
Sprint 4: 20 points completed

Velocity Average: 21.75 points/sprint

// Use velocity to plan future sprints
// If team velocity is 21 points/sprint,
// an 80-point feature = 4 sprints (4 weeks)
```

### Burndown Chart
